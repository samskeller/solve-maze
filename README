For this project, we were asked to write an program that would solve a maze given by the user. The maze is given
in the following format:

0 0 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0

Here, 0's represent open cells and 1's represent walls. The maze begins at the top left corner and ends at the 
bottom right corner. The solution to the maze is printed out in terms of the cells visited to get from the start to
the end.
